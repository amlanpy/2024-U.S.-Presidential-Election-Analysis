SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (AMLAN)

First to do the scrapping, go to https://console.apify.com/
Search for the trudax/reddit-scrapper and run the scrapping according to all the filters needed.
Download the results as any file you want.
2 example results downloaded as Excel files have been attached to the repository.
Copy one of the file paths to the Reddit_sentiment_analysis.py code and run the code.

BOT DETECTION (CHRISTINE)

Run CIS400project.py and it will ask you to type in a subreddit that you want to look into, then it will ask for the number of posts/comments that you want to look for, after answering the two questions it will start crawling and shows you who seems like a bot and who seems like a human.
